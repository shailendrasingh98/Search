# Search
Python app using Django framework that exposes a single endpoint: HTTP service that provides an endpoint for fuzzy search / autocomplete of English words.
You are given a dataset that contains 333,333 English words and the frequency of their usage in
some corpus. A very small sample is shown below:

	track 112385243
	australia 112197265
	discussion 111973466
	archive 111971865
	once 111882023
	others 111397714
	entertainment 111394818
	agreement 111356320
	format 111279626
Let us assume we’re building a web app where the user types in a single word from this list in a
search box. We wish to autocomplete the input in the search box.
Your objective is to write a Python app using Django/Flask framework that exposes a single
endpoint:

GET /search?word=<input>

where input is the (partial) word that the user has typed so far. For example, if the user is looking
up procrastination, the service might receive this sequence of requests:

GET /search?word=pro
GET /search?word=procr
GET /search?word=procra

and so on.

The response should be a JSON array containing upto 25 results, ranked by some criteria (see
below).
Constraints

1. Matches can occur anywhere in the string, not just at the beginning. For example, eryx
should match archaeopteryx (among others).
2. The ranking of results should satisfy the following:
a. We assume that the user is typing the beginning of the word. Thus, matches at the
start of a word should be ranked higher. For example, for the input pract, the result
practical should be ranked higher than impractical.
b. Common words (those with a higher usage count) should rank higher than rare
words.
c. Short words should rank higher than long words. For example, given the input
environ, the result environment should rank higher than environmentalism.
i. As a corollary to the above, an exact match should always be ranked as the
first result.
